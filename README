This is my initial set up of git hub where I'll be hosting most of the
"Hello World" type programs I have while I get the hang of using github.

Special thanks to:
My boss sirMixAlot for sending me to the JQuery Boston 2011 conference,
the JQuery Conf presenters, especially Ben "cowboy" Alman for shaming me into
finally getting my own github account.

Special Thanks to:
opsb for his post about integrating Eclipse-github on Windows.
